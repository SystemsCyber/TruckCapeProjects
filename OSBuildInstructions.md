# Installing the Linux Operating System.

These steps were taken to build the TruckCape recovery SD card. If you have a truck-cape from 2020, then these steps have already been done.

1. Download 

https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-eMMC-flasher-debian-10.3-iot-armhf-2020-04-06-4gb.img.xz

1. Using a utility like 7zip, decompress the image.

1. Using Win32DiskImager, burn the Debian Linux distribution to a 4GB SD partition. This will be a flasher image that will overwrite the eMMC chip in the BeagleBone Black.

1. Insert the flasher image SD card into to the BeagleBone Black. Power on the BBB (i.e. plug in the USB) while depressing the SD boot button until the 4 user LEDs come on. After about 30 seconds, the flasher program will start as indicated by the user leds cycling in a back-and-forth pattern. The reflashing process could take 10-15 minutes, depending on the speed of the SD card. 

## Testing the System
Using an SSH client, like Putty, and a USB to computer connection, connect to the Beagle Bone Black SSH using IP 192.168.7.2 on port 22.

The new login uses the following credentials:

U: debian

P: temppwd

The availability to boot is longer than you might like, but be patient, the board will finish booting and enumerate as a drive on your host computer. 


Connect an active Ethernet cable into your BeagleBone. Check to see if you have a valid IP address on `eth0`:

```
sudo ifconfig
```

### What Version do you have?
Enter the following command `cat /etc/dogtag`:

```
debian@beaglebone:~$ cat /etc/dogtag
BeagleBoard.org Debian Buster IoT Image 2020-04-06
```

Check the kernel version:

```
debian@beaglebone:~$ uname -a
Linux beaglebone 4.19.94-ti-r42 #1buster SMP PREEMPT Tue Mar 31 19:38:29 UTC 2020 armv7l GNU/Linux
```

### Disable Unused Hardware
Edit the uEnv.txt file and uncomment the some disable commands. This opens the pins up for accessing other functions.

```
sudo nano /boot/uEnv.txt
```
Uncommment the disable_uboot_overlay as follows:
```
#dtb_overlay=/lib/firmware/<file8>.dtbo
###
###Disable auto loading of virtual capes (emmc/video/wireless/adc)
#disable_uboot_overlay_emmc=1
disable_uboot_overlay_video=1
disable_uboot_overlay_audio=1
disable_uboot_overlay_wireless=1
disable_uboot_overlay_adc=1
###
```
Be sure to keep the emmc line commented, since that's the root file system.

Also, enable the universal overlay. This ensures the kernel has access to the hardware pin multiplexers. 

```
###Additional custom capes
uboot_overlay_addr4=/lib/firmware/cape-universal.dtbo
#uboot_overlay_addr5=/lib/firmware/<file5>.dtbo
#uboot_overlay_addr6=/lib/firmware/<file6>.dtbo
#uboot_overlay_addr7=/lib/firmware/<file7>.dtbo
###

```

Save and reboot: `sudo shutdown -r now`


### Configure the pins
Write the following commands to get the CAN hardware to access the pins upon boot. 
Create a file in the home directory:

```
nano /etc/pin_config.sh
```
Write the following into the directory:
```
#!/bin/sh -e
# DCAN1
config-pin p9.24 can
config-pin p9.26 can 
# DCAN0
config-pin p9.19 can
config-pin p9.20 can
#ttyO2:
config-pin p9.21 uart
config-pin p9.22 uart
#ttyO4:
config-pin p9.11 uart
config-pin p9.13 uart
#ttyO5:
config-pin p8.37 uart
config-pin p8.38 uart
# PWMs
config-pin p8.46 pwm
config-pin p8.45 pwm
config-pin p8.34 pwm
config-pin p8.36 pwm
# GPIO
config-pin p9.12 gpio
config-pin p9.14 gpio

exit 0
```
Make the script executable:
```
sudo chmod +x /etc/pin_config.sh
```
However, these commands need to be run upon boot, so let's make a script to do this and add it to a boot sequence.

```
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/pin_config.service
```
Add this to the file:
```
[Unit]
Description=Setup for BBB

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/bash /etc/pin_config.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start the service

```
sudo systemctl start pin_config.service
```

Verify the service

```
sudo systemctl status pin_config.service
```
Enable the service at boot

```
sudo systemctl enable pin_config.service
```
To confirm the pin_config.service was enabled, look for a symbolic link in `/etc/systemd/system`

```
debian@beaglebone:/etc/systemd/system$ ls -la
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   38 Sep 17 04:51 pin_config.service -> /lib/systemd/system/pin_config.service
```

Reboot and verify:

```
debian@beaglebone:~$ config-pin -q p9.24

Current mode for P9_24 is:     can


```

Verify the status of the pin_config.service was successful by looking for an output like this:

```
debian@beaglebone:~$ sudo systemctl status pin_config.service
‚óè pin_config.service - Setup for BBB p

```
If this doesn't work, be sure to disable the overlays in the uEnv.txt file.


### Start the network interfaces
Edit your `/etc/network/interfaces` file.

```
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

Add the following lines:

```
allow-hotplug can1
 iface can1 can static
    bitrate 250000

allow-hotplug can0
 iface can0 can static
    bitrate 250000
```
Reboot: `sudo shutdown -r now`

Upon restart, the CAN interfaces should be mounted.

```

## Write a recovery SD card
To duplicate the firmware image on the eMMC of the current Beagle Bone Black, do the following:
1. Remove the BBBlack from the truck cape. Power up with USB. 
1. Insert a blank SD card 4GB or bigger as soon as the user LEDs flash on boot. This timing seems to help ensure the SD card is recognized by the kernel. Plugging in the SD card later may not work. This is a physical hack to ensure the SD card can work.
1. Connect the Ethernet to a live internet connection.
2. Login 
1. Update the scripts
```
cd /opt/scripts
git pull
```
2. Run the command 
```
sudo /opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/beaglebone-black-make-microSD-flasher-from-eMMC.sh 
```
3. Wait for the program to finish.
```
================================================================================
eMMC has been flashed: please wait for device to power down.
================================================================================
Calling shutdown
```
4. Eject the card. It is ready to use.

If the process fails, double check the SD card insertion and timing. 

## Future Work

### Upgrade the Linux Kernel Module for SocketCAN

First, we must upgrade the kernel version on the beaglebone. This step requires a connection between the beaglebone and the internet.
From: https://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#Kernel_Upgrade


```
debian@beaglebone:~$ cd /opt/scripts/tools/
debian@beaglebone:~$ git pull
debian@beaglebone:~$ sudo ./update_kernel.sh --lts-5_4
debian@beaglebone:~$ sudo reboot
```

As of October 7, 2020, this updates to beaglebone kernel 5.4.66-ti-r18.

Next, we need the files for the can-j1939 kernel module. These may be found in the kernel_modules directory of the repository. If the TruckCapeProjects repository is not downloaded, you may download it with the following commands:
```
debian@beaglebone:~$ sudo git clone -b v4Hardware https://github.com/SystemsCyber/TruckCapeProjects.git
```
We also need to install the linux headers to build modules natively on the beaglebone.

```
debian@beaglebone:~$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`

```

Once installed, navigate to the "j1939" directory and compile the kernel module using the "make" command.
```
debian@beaglebone:~$ cd ~/TruckCapeProjects/kernel_modules/j1939
```
Now we need to compile the kernel module.
```
debian@beaglebone:~/TruckCapeProjects/kernel_modules/j1939$ sudo make
```
After making the can-j1939 module, we need to put it into the correct folder.

```
debian@beaglebone:~/TruckCapeProjects/kernel_modules/j1939$ sudo mkdir /lib/modules/5.4.66-ti-r18/kernel/net/can/j1939
debian@beaglebone:~/TruckCapeProjects/kernel_modules/j1939$ sudo cp can-j1939.ko /lib/modules/5.4.66-ti-r18/kernel/net/can/j1939
```

```
debian@beaglebone:~$ sudo depmod
debian@beaglebone:~$ sudo modprobe can-j1939
```
The beaglebone kernel has now been upgraded and includes the j1939 module.

As a final step, we need to install the correct Linux Header Files for local code compilation.

```
debian@beaglebone:~$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
debian@beaglebone:~$ sudo cp -r ~/TruckCapeProjects/header_files/include /usr/
```

The beaglebone kernel is now upgraded to 5.4.x and has the capability to both run and compile code which uses the can-j1939 kernel module.

### Socket-CAN and can-utils
Get the latest version of can-utils that supports J1939. Download the package using curl:

```
debian@beaglebone:~$ curl http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/c/can-utils/can-utils_2020.02.04-3_armhf.deb --output can-utils_2020.02.04-3_armhf.deb
```

Install the package using dpkg

```
debian@beaglebone:~$ sudo dpkg  -i can-utils_2020.02.04-3_armhf.deb
(Reading database ... 72570 files and directories currently installed.)

### C, C++ Cross Compiler
To use programs like clion to cross compile for BeagleBone, use the commands below to install necessary packages:
```
debian@beaglebone:~/repositories/AMP-Challenge-03-Brake-Flasher-BBB$ sudo apt-get install cmake
debian@beaglebone:~/repositories/AMP-Challenge-03-Brake-Flasher-BBB$ sudo apt-get install gdb
